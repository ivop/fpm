Fixed Point Math Library v0.31 beta

## history

Ressurection of a fixed point math library I wrote back in 2005/2006.
It used to be hosted at the long defunct berlios.de.
To my surprise I found it used in [tinysid](https://github.com/robn/tinysid/).
I decided to extract it and give it its own home again.
This repository includes the full commit history of Robert Norris' 20p12 additions, too.

## future

Rewrite as inline functions. Add sample and accuracy test program.
